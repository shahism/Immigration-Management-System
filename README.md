#Immigration_Management_System
It was my first project of programming and Python was my first language. It helped me learn the basics concepts of programming and problem solving, how we can control a big program and its flow, how iteration, conditional and iterative statements work. How one can set up account creation and sign up for the module. I also used a module to email details to the user . It was based upon the target that was to manage the data with CRUD (create read update and delete) operation.
